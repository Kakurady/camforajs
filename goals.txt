* P1 - Project Outline Goals
> observing the robot's behavior
-> speed up and slow down the robots, because they move too fast
-> pause the robots
- choosing simulation settings
-- Start on paused mode
-> Level of synchnony
-> agreement on orientation
-> [...]
- Interaction
-- Dynamic insertion of new robots
-- Dynamic deletion of robots
-- Selection of faulty behaviour
-- (adjust robots' position?)
- Document choices.
  They might lead you to questioning those choices too
-- Why did you choose svg over HTML+CSS, canvas or webgl?
-- why glmatrix? It doesn't have many features.
-- why store movement in global coordinates?
-- why lerp over history?
   ? what kind of history to store? just movement, or also some state? visualizations?
   ? how should algorithms be visualized?
        Current strategy is general vis for some things and specific for others. 
   ? how should the svg output be organized? 
* P2 - use case goals
> I'd like to use this to present robot algorithms at a conference or seminar.
-- does well being resized
-- going full screen
-- endless simulation
> I'd like to experiment with camfora in private
-- graph statistics
-- control panel
-- endable simulation
-- export statistics for off-line analysis and later simulations
> I'd like to embed camfora into a web page for the public.
-- small file size
-- modularized loading
-- minimized dependencies
> I'd like to show other people on a mobile device.
-- small file size
-- performance first
